# Read_VoltageSensor

This is source code to read analog voltage using ESP-32 (Node32S) GPIO 36 or ADC 0.

IDE: VS Code

Extension: Platform IO

You can use source code in file main.cpp to Arduino IDE and INO file, just comment line //#include <Arduino.h>

In this source code is included calibration or correction factor to match output voltage that read by ESP32ADC to voltage value that showed at power supply voltage indicator.
